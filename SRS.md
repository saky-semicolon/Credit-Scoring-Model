## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a Credit Scoring Model that predicts the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. This model will help financial institutions assess credit risk, aiming to reduce loan defaults and improve lending decisions by providing accurate, data-driven insights.

### 1.2 Scope
The Credit Scoring Model will analyze financial data to classify individuals based on their risk level. The scope includes:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering to enhance model effectiveness
- Training and evaluating classification algorithms
- Producing a probability score to indicate creditworthiness

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Creditworthiness**: An individual’s likelihood of fulfilling financial obligations.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Machine learning algorithms used to categorize data points into predefined classes.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score used to assess model performance.

### 1.4 Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Credit Scoring Model, including functional and non-functional specifications, constraints, and data handling practices.
